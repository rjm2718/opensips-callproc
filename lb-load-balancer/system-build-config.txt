virtualbox notes:

TODO: enable vt-x virtualiztion features in HP BIOS (and setup iLO network while you're there),
then reenable with "vboxmanage modifyvm a100 --hwvirtex on"


--------------------------------------

For load balancer node we want to be very frugal when it comes to writing anythign to disk.

/etc/rsyslog.d/50-defaul.conf:

 supress opensips messages from /var/log/syslog:

*.*;auth,authpriv.none;opensips.none        -/var/log/syslog

- local7.* /var/log/opensips.log


opensips.cfg:

debug=1
log_stderror=no
log_facility=LOG_LOCAL7



TODO logrotate


--------------------------------------

For CP node:

 Why do need RPC to an app?

 - for LCR processing, use drouting if you can .. better to have a system somebody else can learn and support.

 - for strip/prefix number format mangling: drouting can do this for r-uri, but for other fields you need to hack away in opensips.cfg, so this could be done more elegantly in code.

 - may need to implement special business logic different for each customer?  what about custom call limits?

 - look into opensips event processing options too ...




TODO: topology hiding (dialog module .. or more comliated b2bua module)?


*note on drouting probing*

 - obviously the CP nodes need good info on what routes are available, but out-of-the-box drouting probing wont work because the CP is on a pvt interface behind the LB node... shit.  Could hack something to communicate state from the LB to all child CP nodes (e.g. use MI to set carriers enabled or disabled).


*note on From/To/Contact header rewriting*

Level 3 wants us to look like we have a SBC, not a proxy, so we'll do our best to hide topology & rewrite headers without having to have the LB be dialog stateful or too complex.

> because record routing is used, we shouldn't care about rewriting Contact host field (L3 still wants the userpart to be e.164)

*note on do_routing()*

Sets a new request URI ==> see the $ru and related variables.  Not to be confused with destination URI ==> see $du and friends.  The latter can be set to route to an outbound proxy, the former is what is used in the request and route headers.
